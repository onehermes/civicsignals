## Title
**Modernizing the Maze: A Citizen-Centered Transformation**

A case study documenting how a federal agency transformed its digital presence to better serve citizens through modern WordPress technology and user-centered design. Task completion rates increased by 55%, and citizens now find eligibility information in under 3 minutes.

## Taxonomies to Assign
- **Audiences:** Citizen, Leadership
- **Themes:** Modernization, Accessibility

## Chapter 1 - The Problem

Citizens were lost. What should have been a simple task—finding information about benefits, services, or programs—became an exercise in frustration. The agency's website felt like a digital maze, built over decades with no clear navigation, broken links hidden behind outdated menus, and critical information buried three or four clicks deep.

Every click that didn't lead to the right information chipped away at public trust. Mobile users faced an even more challenging experience, with menus that didn't work on small screens and forms that were nearly impossible to complete on a phone.

The legacy approach failed to meet modern expectations for accessibility and mobile responsiveness. Citizens expected the same seamless experience they had with private sector websites, but instead encountered a confusing system that felt stuck in the past.

## Chapter 2 - Meet the People

### Maria – Working Parent & Citizen

**Quote:** "I just want to quickly see if my family qualifies for benefits."

**Pain Points:**
- Needs to access information during limited breaks at work
- Mobile experience is frustrating and confusing
- Gives up after 3–4 failed attempts to find answers
- Can't afford to spend hours navigating confusing menus
- Needs clear, direct answers to eligibility questions

Maria works full-time and manages her household. When she needs to check benefit eligibility, she expects to find the information quickly on her phone during her lunch break. Instead, she encounters a confusing menu system that does not work well on mobile devices. After multiple failed attempts, she abandons the site and calls the help desk—waiting on hold for 20 minutes just to ask a simple question.

### James – Content Editor

**Quote:** "Updating content feels like untangling a web of HTML."

**Pain Points:**
- Spends hours making simple content updates
- Wishes he could focus on content quality instead of markup
- Frustrated by inconsistent formatting across pages
- Has to coordinate with developers for every change
- Lacks confidence to make updates independently

James manages the agency's web content, but every update requires wrestling with complex HTML and inconsistent styling. What should take five minutes becomes a two-hour task involving code editing, cross-browser testing, and hoping nothing breaks. He dreams of a system where he can simply write content and know it will look right automatically.

### Avery – Program Director

**Quote:** "We need data-driven insights into how citizens interact with our services."

**Pain Points:**
- Can't measure whether services are actually helping people
- Lacks actionable analytics to improve service delivery
- Struggles to demonstrate impact to stakeholders
- Needs to justify budget requests with real data
- Wants to understand where citizens struggle most

Avery oversees multiple programs and needs to demonstrate their impact to leadership and Congress. But without proper analytics, she can't tell which programs are working, where citizens are getting stuck, or how to improve service delivery. She needs data to make informed decisions, but the current system provides none.

## Chapter 3 - The Discovery

The transformation began with a comprehensive audit. We analyzed every page, every link, every user flow. We interviewed citizens like Maria, content editors like James, and program directors like Avery. We watched real users navigate the site and documented every frustration, every dead end, every moment of confusion.

The findings were stark: 68% of visitors left the site without finding what they needed. Average time to complete simple tasks exceeded 8 minutes. Mobile users struggled even more, with task completion rates under 50%.

But we also discovered something important: when we asked citizens what they wanted, their answers were remarkably consistent. Clear navigation. Direct answers. Mobile-friendly design. Accessibility for all.

## Chapter 4 - The Storytelling System

This wasn't just about redesigning a website—it was about building a system for continuous storytelling. Every modernization project, every service improvement, every user research finding could become a Story in the system.

Stories are organized by Audience (who you're serving) and Theme (the core topic—Accessibility, Performance, Modernization, Governance). Content editors use reusable block patterns to build consistent narratives without code, maintaining design standards automatically while focusing on what matters: telling the story of impact.

The system empowers content editors like James to build beautiful, consistent narratives without touching HTML. It gives program directors like Avery the ability to document their work and demonstrate value. And it ensures citizens like Maria can find the information they need quickly and easily.

## Chapter 5 - Impact Metrics

The results speak for themselves:

**Task Success Rate:** 62% → 94% (+55%)

Citizens can now successfully complete tasks that previously led to frustration and abandonment. The improved navigation, clearer content structure, and mobile-optimized design removed the barriers that were preventing success.

**Time to Find Eligibility Info:** 8.5 minutes → 2.1 minutes (-75%)

What used to take nearly 9 minutes of clicking, reading, and confusion now takes just over 2 minutes. Maria can check benefit eligibility during her lunch break without spending half of it navigating menus.

**Bounce Rate:** 68% → 22% (-68%)

Visitors are staying on the site and finding what they need. The reduction in bounce rate represents thousands of citizens who no longer give up in frustration.

**WCAG 2.1 AA Compliance:** Achieved

The new site meets accessibility standards, ensuring that all citizens, regardless of ability, can access the information and services they need.

## Chapter 6 - Accessibility by Design

Accessibility wasn't an afterthought—it was fundamental to the design from day one. We implemented semantic headings, keyboard navigation, proper ARIA landmarks, and color contrast that meets WCAG 2.1 AA standards.

Screen reader users can navigate the site efficiently. Keyboard-only users can access all functionality. Users with low vision can read all content clearly. The site works for everyone, not just some.

This commitment to accessibility reflects our belief that public services must serve all citizens, regardless of ability. When we make the site more accessible, we don't just meet a requirement—we fulfill our mission.

## Chapter 7 - The Road Ahead

The transformation is complete, but the journey continues. We've built a system that makes it easy to document new modernization efforts, share lessons learned, and measure impact over time.

Every new Story in the system contributes to a larger narrative: that government can deliver digital experiences that meet modern expectations, serve all citizens equitably, and build trust through transparency.

The maze has been replaced with a clear path forward. Citizens like Maria can find what they need quickly. Content editors like James can focus on quality instead of code. Program directors like Avery can demonstrate impact with real data.

This is what modern public sector digital transformation looks like: putting citizens first, measuring what matters, and telling the story of impact.
